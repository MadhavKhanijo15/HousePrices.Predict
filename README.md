House Price Prediction using EDA and Linear Regression
This is a beginner-friendly project where I explored a housing dataset from Kaggle using Python.

## Project Highlights:
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Cleaned missing values and handled outliers
- Visualized data distributions, correlations, and trends
- Built a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluated model performance using R² score
- Compared predicted vs actual house prices

## Libraries Used:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Feature Selection
- Regression Modeling
- Evaluation Metrics

## Dataset:
The dataset was taken from Kaggle (California Housing Prices).

## Note:
This project was my first hands-on with machine learning and I’ve documented the entire learning process
